PROBLEMS WITH THREAT MODELLING - What makes threat model incomplete?
Constrain to functionality - Only looking at the function used and not looking at all functions offered.
Focusing on technical trickery - Looking heavily from a technical lens and liimiting to the technical scope.
Focusing on todays issue (not past or future).
Poor risk rating - using CVSS for risk rating.
Limited knowledge of attacks - Not using Mitre Att&ck / D3fend type frameworks.
Known Attacks / Known defences approach - Sticking to known security controls.

THREAT MODEL TYPES - 
Assessing attack surfaces and patching them for threats. (Problem - Unknown attack surface are missed)
Looking at risks and fixing them. (Problem - Stress on risk assessment, may yield more / less work due to improper assessment).
Deviation from security architecture and best practice. (Works well but best practice are generic not specific).
Other approach 
- TM for credible attack scenario.
- TM for threat use cases outside risk appetite.
- TM should last the lifetime of the system (at least until the next review).
- TM to align to Pareto principle (80/20 rule).
- Alingn TM to Mitre ATT&CK / D3Fend.
